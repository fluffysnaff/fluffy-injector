## What is Fluffy Injector?

**Fluffy Injector** is a `Windows injector tool` that replaces complex command-line utilities with a clean, intuitive graphical interface. Built entirely in Rust, it provides a safe and efficient way to perform `DLL injection`. It's the perfect utility for:

*   **Developers:** Quickly test your custom DLLs in a live environment.
*   **Security Researchers:** Analyze process behavior and interactions.
*   **Modders & Enthusiasts:** Experiment with game or application modifications in a controlled way.

The goal is to make `DLL injection` accessible and straightforward without sacrificing control.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **üîç Smart Process Scanning:** Lists all running processes with their name, PID, and application icon for easy identification.
*   **‚ö° Real-time Filtering:** Instantly search the process list to find exactly what you're looking for.
*   **üîÑ Auto-Refresh Option:** Keep the process list up-to-date automatically without manual refreshes.
*   **üìÇ Easy DLL Management:** Add DLLs via a file dialog, manage them in a persistent list, and remove them when they're no longer needed.
*   **üöÄ One-Click Injection:** Injects the selected DLL into the target process using the reliable `CreateRemoteThread` and `LoadLibraryA` method.
*   **üíæ Session Persistence:** Remembers your list of DLLs and the last selected application, so you can pick up right where you left off.
*   **üé® Modern Dark UI:** Built with Rust's immediate-mode `egui GUI` framework for a responsive, cross-platform feel.
*   **üîî Toast Notifications:** Get instant, non-intrusive feedback on injection success, warnings, or failures.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Users (Recommended)

1.  **Download:** Grab the latest `injector.exe` from the [**GitHub Releases Page**](https://github.com/fluffysnaff/fluffy-injector/releases).
2.  **Run:** Place the executable in a folder of your choice and run it. No installation is required.
3.  **Inject:**
    *   Select a target process from the left panel.
    *   Click "Add DLL" to add your desired DLL to the list in the right panel.
    *   Select the DLL you just added.
    *   Click "Inject DLL"!

### For Developers (Building from Source)

1.  **Requirements:**
    *   [Rust Toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) (stable)
    *   Git
2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fluffysnaff/fluffy-injector.git
    cd fluffy-injector
    ```
3.  **Build and Run:**
    ```bash
    # For a debug build
    cargo run
    
    # For a release build (recommended for performance)
    cargo run --release 
    ```
    The final executable will be located in the `target/release` directory.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

Fluffy Injector is built with a modern Rust ecosystem:

*   **[egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) & [eframe](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/crates/eframe):** For the immediate-mode graphical user interface.
*   **[windows-rs](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs):** For safe, idiomatic bindings to the Windows APIs required for injection and icon extraction.
*   **[sysinfo](https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez/sysinfo):** For cross-platform system information, used here for process scanning.
*   **[rfd](https://github.com/PolyMeilex/rfd):** For native, platform-appropriate "open file" dialogs.
*   **[Serde](https://serde.rs/):** For robust serialization/deserialization of the configuration file.
